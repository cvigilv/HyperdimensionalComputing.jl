# # Replicating "What’s the Dollar of Mexico?" in `HyperdimensionalComputing.jl`
#
# Kanerva showcases in this publication how we can create prototype concepts and mappings between
# them using Hyperdimensional Computing (HDC), a computing paradigm based on very big random vectors
# populated with binary values.
#
# This very big random vectors, which we calls "words" or "codes", represent concepts, but when
# analyzing this as mathematical constructs they are nothing else than random signals. When
# combined using bundling and binding operations, one can construct concepts and reason based on
# the similarity of this words, always assuming that this retrieval is approximated.
#
# Since the properties of the operations that enable composability of this "codes" are
# mathematically grounded, the characteristics of the operations permeate into this modelling
# mindset and enable for the creation of (i) prototype representations and (ii) mapping function,
# both based on the same underlying mathematical structure. Thanks to this, we can either model
# mapping one concept into another space or directly map a mapping function from one space into
# another, basically mimicking how the brain works:
#
# > The literal image created by the words is intended to be transferred to and interpreted in a
#   new context, exemplifying the mind's reliance on prototypes: the literal meaning provides the
#   prototype. When the mind expands its scope in this way it creates an incredibly rich web of
#   associations and meaning...
#
# To showcase this, we will reimplement the example proposed by Kanerva on this paper.

using HyperdimensionalComputing

# In HDC, concepts are represented as high-dimensional random vectors (hypervectors).
# Here, we create hypervectors for the abstract concepts of COUNTRY, CAPITAL, and MONEY.
COUNTRY = BipolarHV(:country)
CAPITAL = BipolarHV(:capital)
MONEY = BipolarHV(:money)

COUNTRY, CAPITAL, MONEY

# Next, we create hypervectors for specific instances: countries, their capitals, and currencies.
USA = BipolarHV(:usa)
MEX = BipolarHV(:mexico)

WDC = BipolarHV(:wdc)      # Washington DC
MXC = BipolarHV(:mxc)      # Mexico City

DOL = BipolarHV(:dollar)
PES = BipolarHV(:peso)

USA, MEX, WDC, MXC, DOL, PES

# We now build holistic representations for the United States and Mexico by binding each concept
# (country, capital, money) to its specific instance and then adding them together.
USTATES = (COUNTRY * USA) + (CAPITAL * WDC) + (MONEY * DOL)
MEXICO = (COUNTRY * MEX) + (CAPITAL * MXC) + (MONEY * PES)

USTATES, MEXICO

# These composite hypervectors encode all the information about each country in a single vector.
# The `Base.isapprox` function or `≈` operator checks if two hypervectors are approximately equal
# (i.e., similar).
USTATES ≈ MEXICO

# By binding (represented by the `*` operator) the holistic representations of USA and Mexico, we
# create a new hypervector that encodes the relationships between their respective elements: USA
# with Mexico, Washington DC with Mexico City, and dollar with peso, plus some noise due to the
# high-dimensional operations.
F_UM = USTATES * MEXICO

#
F_UM ≈ (USA * MEX) + (WDC * MXC) + (DOL * PES)

# To answer Kanerva's question "What in Mexico corresponds to United States' dollar?", we unbind
# (represented again by the `*` operator) the dollar hypervector with the USA-Mexico relationship
# vector. The result should be similar to the peso hypervector.
DOL * F_UM ≈ PES

# Let's add another country, Sweden, with its capital and currency.
SWE = BipolarHV(:sweden)
STO = BipolarHV(:stockholm)
SEK = BipolarHV(:krona)

SWEDEN = (COUNTRY * SWE) + (CAPITAL * STO) + (MONEY * SEK)

# We can now explore more complex relationships by binding and combining these holistic representations.
# For example, `F_SU`encodes the relationship between Sweden and USA, and F_SM between Sweden and Mexico.
F_UM = USTATES * MEXICO
F_SU = SWEDEN * USTATES
F_SM = SWEDEN * MEXICO

# Combining these relationship vectors allows us to infer new relationships, such as how Sweden relates
# to Mexico via the USA.
F_SU * F_UM ≈ F_SM

# We can also directly query for corresponding elements between countries:

# For example, what is the currency of Mexico, given the currency of the USA?
USTATES * DOL ≈ MEXICO * PES

# Or, what is the currency of Mexico, given the USA and its currency?
USTATES * DOL * MEXICO ≈ PES

# Similarly, we can query for Sweden's currency using the same approach.
USTATES * DOL * MEXICO ≈ SEK

# Or, recover the original currency of the USA.
USTATES * DOL * MEXICO ≈ DOL

# This tutorial demonstrates how hyperdimensional computing enables analogical reasoning and flexible
# querying by representing and manipulating concepts as high-dimensional vectors.
